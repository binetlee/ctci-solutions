##https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/
##You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

##Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
from collections import *
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':

d = Solution().twoSum
print(d([2, 7, 11, 15],17))
